# Recreating the Past
This repository contains my code for each of the recreation assignments in MAS.S62: Recreating the Past, taught by Zach Lieberman. 

## Week 1: Vera Molnár
This week, I tried to recreate Vera Molnár's *Sigma-B* (2013). In the image below, the original is shown on the left, while my attempted recreation is shown on the right.

## Week 2: John Whitney
Drawn to the mesmerizing glow of the shapes that slide into a whole greater than the sum of its parts, I took on a 24-second segment from Whitney's *Arabesque* (1975). What you see below is a still taken from the final frame of each animation, with the original on the left and the recreation on the right. As you can see, it's close, but some of the lines need tweaking.

## Week 3: Muriel Cooper
I took a bit of creative freedom this week with my recreation of a mathematics textbook cover. In the two-dimensional graphic, I love the ambiguity as to which set of horizontal lines is nearer to the foreground, and which one is further away. I tried to emphasize this in my interactive version [here](https://github.com/jessicashand/recreatingthepast/blob/main/recreations/3d.mov).

## Week 4: Odili Donald Odita
This week, I recreated Odita's _Mamba Negra_. His use of color and saturation is humbling, and I'd love to refine this a little more to get just the right balance of light and shadow!

## Week 5: Ken Knowlton
Here's Ken Knowlton's _This is Not Not a Teapot_. I was immediately drawn to the underlying concept and subversive play on Magritte’s _The Treachery of Images_. I also love how the shards condense on one end of the teapot and begin to disperse on the other, creating the illusion of movement.
