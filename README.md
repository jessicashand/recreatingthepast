# Recreating the Past
This repository contains my code for each of the recreation assignments in MAS.S62: Recreating the Past, taught by Zach Lieberman. 

## Week 1: Vera Molnár
This week, I tried to recreate Vera Molnár's *Sigma-B* (2013). In the image below, the original is shown on the left, while my attempted recreation is shown on the right.

## Week 2: John Whitney
Drawn to the mesmerizing glow of the shapes that slide into a whole greater than the sum of its parts, I took on a 24-second segment from Whitney's *Arabesque* (1975). What you see below is a still taken from the final frame of each animation, with the original on the left and the recreation on the right. As you can see, it's close, but needs a little bit of tweaking of some line lengths.
