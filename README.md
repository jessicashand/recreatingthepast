# Recreating the Past
This repository contains my code for each of the recreation assignments in MAS.S62: Recreating the Past, taught by Zach Lieberman. 

## Week 1: Vera Molnár
This week, I tried to recreate Vera Molnár's *Sigma-B* (2013). In the image below, the original is shown on the left, while my attempted recreation is shown on the right.
